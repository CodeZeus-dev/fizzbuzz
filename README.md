# FizzBuzz #

The fizzbuzz.rb script executes the FizzBuzz algorithm on a given number. The script contains the fizzbuzz method, which, given an integer argument, it returns "fizz" for multiples of 3, "buzz" for multiples of 5, "fizzbuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5, and the integer number itself if not a multiple of either 3 or 5. The project was implemented following the TDD protocol, by using RSpec, and by collaborating through Pair Programming. :neckbeard:
